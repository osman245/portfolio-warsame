How to start off a single page React App....

Make sure you have NodeJs installed...
Download VSCode or your IDE of choice...

Open VSCode..
Download the starter files on command line using npx create-react-app <app name of choice>
"cd <app-name> go into the created folder directory
enter code . to start up a new VSCode window..
npm start to start up the application
Delete the unnecessary things


Create folders..(components, image for images) create jsx and css files for all components
Use emmmet
Use rafce, to create an initial react module for jsx files
put dummy data in all jsx modules to see how it would layout
Put all components into the app jsx module because the entry point to the code, index.js, renders the App component.


In the index css, get some google fonts..

reset css....Set all elements to have margin,padding,border,outline to 0 and box-sizing to border box ensuring we dont take 
up extra space..

Set :root to redundant values that will be used throughout the course of the project.




Go through index css , create and declare your properties..all components inherit indexcss, but only header gets headercss properties...

Start off with the header.. create more and import components to the header component if need be.

For icons install npm package "react-icons --save"


Tackle jsx first, then add css in it.

Tackle component by component one by one...
